# Blog System Setup Guide

## Overview
Your Krishna Flute Academy website now has a fully functional blog system with:
- **Blog Component**: Displays published blog posts with filtering by tags
- **BlogAdmin Component**: Create, edit, and manage blog posts
- **Supabase Integration**: Database backend for storing blog posts

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new account
2. Create a new project
3. Note down your project URL and anon key from the project settings

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following content:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
```

Replace the values with your actual Supabase project URL and anon key.

### 3. Database Setup
Apply the migration to create the blog_posts table:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20251016051147_create_blog_posts_table.sql`
4. Run the SQL script

This will create:
- `blog_posts` table with all necessary fields
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
